In kernel 3.4.74,sometimes you maybe encounter a kernel panic , and the oops stack is related to function l2cap_chan_destory
This is a kernel bug, which is a double free problem.
To fix this bug, please refer to the below link:

https://github.com/rwg0/linux/commit/837e00505542e25c253ecffd93b35776f9079582

The reason is that "chan->global_l" maybe deleted twice if we don't use "refcnt" to protect it.
This bug is fixed after Kernel 3.7.x.
