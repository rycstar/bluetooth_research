* This file will show the different pairing mode in bluetooth.

a. Actually, bluez4.95 offer a lot of test tools for user, and 'agent' must be the special one.
   In bluez4.95/test ,there are two files named 'agent.c' and 'simple_agent'.
   They do the sames things , but one is wrote with C lang, the other one use Python. 
   This is important for us to understand the other python script, and translate them into C.
   Note: Most of the test tools which need to use dbus system are wrote in Python. 
   
b. First, let's try to connect to remote device
   1. 'hcitool scan' to find remote device
      Scanning ...
        F0:6D:78:31:66:16	OPPO R11s
        90:C7:D8:1C:0F:26	NX529J
        DC:F0:90:16:A0:7D	nubia Z17mini
   2. agent -a hci0 0000 F0:6D:78:31:66:16
        This cmd is try to connect the remote device 'F0:6D:78:31:66:16'
   3. agent -a hci0 0000 &
        This cmd is listening and waiting for other device come in.
        Note: Usually, our device can't be scaned by other device, use cmd 'hciconfig hci0 piscan' to enable it.
        For more details about 'piscan' , read the file 'bluetooth_essentials_for_programmers.4272206415.pdf'
   Extension:
        'hcitool cc <bdaddr>' also can pair with remore device, but is seems not support "DisplayYesOrNo" mode. (Not sure yet :))

c. What does the agent do ?
   1. For connect to remote device, it call the method 'CreatePairedDevice' in "org.bluez.Adapter", and waiting for the dbus message
   to notify the UI layer that weather need 'RequestPinCode' or 'RequestConfirmation' and others.
   
   2. For waiting for remote device ,it call the method 'RegisterAgent' in "org.bluez.Adapter", and waiting for the dbus message
   to notify the UI layer that weather need 'RequestPinCode' or 'RequestConfirmation' and others.
   
   Note: all message are transferred in dbus system ,no matter about ' method called ' or 'state changed', so understand dbus message transmit
   is essential.
   If two device have beed paired, when the remote device power off and the power on ,bluez can auto connect it.

d. Question: what does 'CreatePairedDevice' and 'RegisterAgent' do ?
   Answer: Just read the source code. :)
           I can tell you, at the last ,they all call hci ioctls to interacted with kernel.
