a. run bluetoothd without backgorund mode and enable debug option
   cmd: bluetoothd -n -d &
   In this cmd, you can see the logs in your console. If you want to add or delete some logs in bluez source code,
   you can add 'printf' to trace the code. Notice, only in '-n -d' mode, you can see the changes, or you can't see anything
   
   In the same way, obexd,obex-client should also run in '-n -d' mode if you want to debug for it.
   
b. hcidump
   hcidump is the most important tool for bluetooth issue analysis.
   It can capture all the bluetooth packet that we received and sent.
   Sometimes we can check the packets we send whether it's correct according to the BLUETOOTH SPEC
   The usage of hcidump is also simple:
        hcidump  â€“w <filename> &
